CLI tool for downloading youtube videos at its best available quality. Meant to be used with opencv. pytube3 is required. Run pip install pytube3 .

### Scenario
You are beginning to really grasp computer vision and basic machine learnning concepts and want to go beyond your webcam and use youtube videos where you can use opencv-python to detect things in videos like:
#### Faces, Eyes, Cars, Features etc. 

### ***Usage: python tubejackal.py <URL TO YOUTUBE VIDEO>***
#### ***Example: python tubejackal.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4h1t7QQY64*** 

## Thats it!

##### Feel free to clone and add to it. 
### Requirements: pytube3 <pip install pytube3>
### I Recommend using in a virtual environment
##### ***Ex2: virtualenv jackal , activate the virtualenv and use pip to download pytube3

Use tubejackal as a quick tool alongside machine learning libraries to rapidly build experimental datasets using Youtube as a data source

I also highly recommend installing Anaconda for python 3.x NOT 2.x!
